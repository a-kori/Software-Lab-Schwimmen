# Software Lab Schwimmen Project

Schwimmen is a social card game for two to four players that is popular in Germany and Austria. Within the framework of the Software Lab offered to Computer Science students at TU Dortmund, I have developed a Kotlin application, aiming to allow users to play Schwimmen together.

The project is supposed to train:
* programming skills and software engineering methods, especially the application-specific use of the acquired knowledge,
* development of software according to a given model,
* use of an IDE with phase-specific tools,
* analysis of project requirements and project architecture design,
* peer code review.

Tools used in the project:
* Kotlin
* Java Development Kit
* IntelliJ IDEA
* GitLab
* Astah Professional
* BoardGameWork framework

This is one of the two planned projects in the TU Dortmund's Software Lab.
